About
======================

Crime, Climate & Population is a project that a partner and I made for Visual Analytics class. This project aims to answer whether there's a correlation between crime rate, annual climate and population in the U.S. The system reads three different datasets (csv files), crime rate data, climate data and population data. The data is presented using choropleth map to allow easy analysis and interaction with each individual state.
